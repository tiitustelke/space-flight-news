# Space Flight News
A code challenge app for a recruiting process. This Android app shows space-related news articles using [Space Flights News Api](https://www.spaceflightnewsapi.net/).
## (Nice) things about this app
This app is done using Jetpack Compose, which I like quite much as it makes building UI easier with less code. The architecture follows MVVM.
The article list view has swipe refresh. The UI is clear. Dates are formatted according to user locale.
## How can I run this app?
1. Clone this repository (`git clone git@https://github.com/tiitustelke/space-flight-news.git`).
2. Connect your physical Android device and make sure the [USB debugging](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options) is enabled or use the emulator.
3. Choose your device from a device dropdown menu and run the application from the Android Studio's play button. Building the application might take for a while.
